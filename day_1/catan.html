            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>This object of the game is to reach ten victory points. Players score one point for each settlement they
                own
                and two for each city. Various other achievements, such as establishing the longest road and the largest
                army (by playing the most knight cards), grant a player additional victory points. </p>

            <h2>Game Play</h2>
            <p>
                Players build by spending resources (wool, grain, lumber, brick, and ore) that are depicted by these
                resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific
                resource: hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and
                pastures produce wool. On each player's turn, two six-sided dice are rolled to determine which hexes
                produce resources. Players with a settlement adjacent to a hex containing the number just rolled receive
                one card of the corresponding resource; cities produce two cards of the corresponding resource. For
                example, if a player has one city and two settlements adjacent to a grain hex, that player would take
                four grain resource cards if the corresponding number was rolled.
