            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                The objective of codenames is to correctly guess all of your teams’ code words on the board before the
                other team does and without guessing the assassin. This is possible because your Spymaster will give you
                a one-word clue and a number. Using this information and similar clues throughout the game your team
                will try to interpret the spymaster’s clue and guess each code word.
            </p>

            <h2>Game Play</h2>
            <p>
                Players split into two teams: red and blue. One player of each team is selected as the team's spymaster;
                the others are field operatives.
                Twenty-five Codename cards, each bearing a word, are laid out in a 5×5 grid, in random order. A number
                of these words represent red agents, a number represent blue agents, one represents an assassin, and the
                others represent innocent bystanders.
                The teams' spymasters are given a randomly-dealt map card showing a 5×5 grid of 25 squares of various
                colors, each corresponding to one of the code name cards on the table. Teams take turns. On each turn,
                the appropriate spymaster gives a verbal hint about the words on the respective cards. Each hint may
                only consist of one single word and a number. The spymaster gives a hint that is related to as many of
                the words on his/her own agents' cards as possible, but not to any others – lest they accidentally lead
                their team to choose a card representing an innocent bystander, an opposing agent, or the assassin.
