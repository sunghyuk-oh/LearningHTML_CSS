            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all your tiles. Tiles can be played into
                the middle when in a set. A set can be three or four tiles of the same rank, in different colors known
                as a group. Also, a set can be a run of three or more consecutive numbers in the same color known as a
                run.

            </p>

            <h2>Game Play</h2>
            <p>
                In order to start playing, a playerâ€™s first sets must have a value (total of the numbers on the tiles
                being played) of 30 or more. When players are unable to play, they draw a tile as their turn. A player
                can play as many sets as he/she wants to on a turn.

                After a player has made the first move with a value over 30, any tiles can be played to the middle.
                Tiles can be added to other sets, and sets can be moved around to form new sets. A player can move the
                tiles in the middle as much as wanted as long as at least one tile came from his/her pile, and every
                tile ends up in an acceptable set.

                The joker tile can be used as any number and color to help complete a set. Any time a player has a tile
                that a joker is representing, the tile can replace the joker. When the joker is replaced, it must be
                used in a new set on the same turn.
